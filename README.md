This program is a network packet capture and analysis tool with a graphical user interface built using Tkinter. It allows users to capture network packets on a specified interface, save the capture to a pcap file, and monitor the packet count in real-time. The program also includes an alert system that notifies the user and sends an email if the packet count exceeds a set threshold. Additionally, it visualizes packet distribution and count over time using Matplotlib.
